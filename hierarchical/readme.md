Create the directory that you want in the folder that you are worling in right now
Create the file that you want in the folder that you are working in
if you want to create a sub folder in the folder that you have created then, add the folder name in whoch you want to create the sub folder as the value of parent name

<h1>if you want to create sub sub files or folders then follow the </h1>

1)name of directory = subfolder/subfolder/(etc)/nameOfDirectory
  name of parent =parentFOlderName

The same principle can be applied for files
